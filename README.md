# UFOs

## Overview

Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS build webpages to display a table organizing UFO sightings data.

### Purpose

Using the tools mentioned above, a dynamic webpage will be built in which the data concerning UFO sightings can be stored, displayed visually, and be interative (able to filter based on search criteria). Having a dynamic website allows the data to be visually appealing and easy to access for everyone. Sifting through data manually in a table or array can be tedious but having a interactive website allows data access and understanding to be attainable to everyone.

## Results
